# Crack-the-Covid-19-Crisis-Chatbot
When a new disease emerges, communication systems are one of the first systems to become stressed and overwhelmed by the bevy of requests, emergencies, and panics that are attributed to the unknown. Addressing crisis communication is crucial.
Therefore we have come up with a chatbot called "Medic" which addresses frequently asked questions related to the crisis and tries to provide answers to them.
Medic also identifies symptoms based on user response and tells them if they could be infected or not. It provides a dynamic count of patients in India and around the world. It also gives news updates related to Covid-19 from various sources. 
Medic has a database for various hospitals in India that provide treatment for Covid-19 and recommends them to the user based on the states/zones.
